/* 
 * Ford Head Unit to iOS AUX Interface with BLE control v1.3
 * LATEST UPDATES & PROJECT AT GITHUB.COM/ansonl/ford-acp-aux
 *
 * The code in this file is intended to be uploaded to an Arduino used in combination with a specialized shield that contains the hardware needed to interface with a Ford head unit and iOS TRRS audio port.
 *
 * Compatible Ford Head Units: Any unit that uses ACP (Automotive CommunicationProtocol) and has a connector for a CD changer.
 *
 * Info on ACP:
 * http://www.mictronics.de/projects/cdc-protocols/#FordACP
 *                             
 * Some examples are: 4050RDS, 4500, 4600RDS, 5000RDS, 5000RDS EON, 6000CD RDS, 6000 MP3, 7000RDS
 *
 * These are all head units from the '96 - '07 era.
 *
 * The units used during testing are:
 * 1W1F-18C870-DA 02 03 '99 Ford Expedition
 * Navigation Head Unit '07 Ford Escape Hybrid
 *
 * The code for the ACP protocol was originally written by Andrew Hammond for his Yampp and was ported over to the Arduino platform by Krzysztof Pintscher. Please see the ACP and CD headers for more info.
 *
 * This project has been tested to be working with 2007 Ford Escape Hybrid audio system.
